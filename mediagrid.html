AI can enable machines to:Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that uses algorithms, data, and computational power to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities in machines and software. The goal of AI is to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI applications can range from simple, repetitive tasks to complex, cognitive tasks. 
            Some examples of AI applications include: Digital assistants, GPS guidance, Autonomous vehicles, and Generative AI tools. 
            AI is a broad field that encompasses theories and developments in computer science, cognitive science, mathematics, philosophy, neuroscience, and linguistics.
